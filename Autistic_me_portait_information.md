## The love heart mark ♥️ 

The signficance of the love heart marks is that I have big smooth freckle under the corner of my eye kind of similar to Harley Quinn tattooed heart. She is my favourite comic anti-Hero and like her I have study pyschology as well as spent time in an asylum. I feel like we are kindred spirits.

## The colour choice 

I find it hard to relate to the idea that as autistic person that I am meant to have black and white thinking. I feel that my thinking has some nuace to it and have been trained through Intentional peer support to hold space for multiple worldviews and sometime conflict worldviews. That my thinking has some grey area and complexity.

## How the peice Devoeloped 

- **Stage 1:** The photo for "Autistic me" portrait was take while waiting for a bus after an close public meltdown. That day I realised how effective a chewelry is at claming me down. Putting the skull chewie rapidly calmed me down and disarmed a meltdown.

- **Stage 2:** Being inspired by what the spontaneous portrait photo which lead to a lead pencil drawing in my sketch book. To me my sketch is place for experimentation. Allowing me not feel so precious of what I create in the book. In turn enabling me to be freer with my creativity. 

- **Stage 3:** Realizing the potential of the lead pencil drawing. 

- **Stage 4:** Submitting series art peices to an art exhibition that includes autistic me portrait.
